# メモ

# Write a function that splits a dataset (X, y) into train/val/test sets with specific behavior:
# - Accept a list of indices (edge_idx) that must always be included in the training set.
# - The remaining data should be split into train/val/test with a given ratio, default (3, 1, 1).
# - Return the split arrays: X_tr, X_val, X_te, y_tr, y_val, y_te.
# - Also return a PredefinedSplit object for validation (val indices marked as 0, others as -1).
# - Use scikit-learn's train_test_split and PredefinedSplit when possible.
