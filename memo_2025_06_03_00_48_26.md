Certainly! Hereâ€™s a simple sample Bash script that greets the user and shows the current date and time:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Ask for the user's name
read -p "What is your name? " name

# Greet the user
echo "Hello, $name!"

# Show the current date and time
echo "The current date and time is: $(date)"

# List files in the current directory
echo "Here are the files in your current directory:"
ls -lh
```

**How to use:**
1. Copy the script into a file, for example: `greet.sh`
2. Make it executable: `chmod +x greet.sh`
3. Run it: `./greet.sh`
